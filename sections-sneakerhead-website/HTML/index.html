                 release of the original Keds sneakers by advertising agent Henry Nelson Mckinney. The shoe’s rubber 
                 sole muffled the sounds of footsteps, making them almost silent, also making
                 it a whole lot easier to ‘sneak’ up on someone – hence the word ‘sneakers’ was born.</p>

                A basketball superstar from Indiana named Chuck Taylor endorsed these
                 sneakers and the Chuck Taylor All-Stars became the best-selling basketball shoes of all time.</p>

                 by the name of Adi Dassler, created the sneaker brand: Adidas, named after himself. The brand then became the most popular athletic shoe in the world.
                  Adidas introduced leather and suede into the marketplace in the early 1970s.
                 When pro basketball players started wearing them, an entirely new world of footwear was born.</p>

                 his wife’s waffle iron would make the perfect tread he had envisioned for Nike’s first pair of running shoes.
                 He was developing sneakers for his athletes that had the perfect grip for any surface.</p>

                 but the true watershed moments came in the mid-1980s when the
                 first Air Jordan’s dropped – considered the most world-renowned,
