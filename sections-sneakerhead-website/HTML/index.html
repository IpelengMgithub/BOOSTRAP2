                 sole muffled the sounds of footsteps, making them almost silent, also making
                 it a whole lot easier to ‘sneak’ up on someone – hence the word ‘sneakers’ was born.</p>

                 by the name of Adi Dassler, created the sneaker brand: Adidas, named after himself. The brand then became the most popular athletic shoe in the world.
                  Adidas introduced leather and suede into the marketplace in the early 1970s.
                 When pro basketball players started wearing them, an entirely new world of footwear was born.</p>

                     You feel good about your look.
