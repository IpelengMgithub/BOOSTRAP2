# BOOSTRAP2
projects that use the framework boostrap on the project

Welcome to the sneaker head website where I use boostrap(framework),HTML(coding language),CSS(style langauge).

The layout of the project is based on using sections.
This means every section on the margin will have it's own section on the web page.

I think coding can also be a way to express the things you like using zeros and ones.
